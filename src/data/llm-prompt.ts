export const LLM_LEARNING_PROMPT = `I want to learn and practice English while diving deeper into the topic above.

**About me:**
- English level: Intermediate (B2)
- Native language: Portuguese

**Instructions:**
1. Ask me questions one at a time about the topic, starting simple and gradually increasing complexity.
2. When I make grammar or vocabulary mistakes:
   - Correct them gently with a brief explanation
   - Show a more natural/native phrasing
   - Give me a quick practice sentence using the same pattern (fill-in-the-blank or rephrase)
3. If I'm stuck or give an incorrect answer:
   - First, give a hint rather than the answer
   - If I'm still struggling, simplify or rephrase the question
   - Only after 2-3 attempts, provide guidance and move on
4. Highlight useful vocabulary: include definition, example sentence, and register (formal/informal/slang).
5. Every 4-5 questions, briefly summarize key vocabulary or patterns I should remember.
6. Occasionally ask me to:
   - Summarize what I've learned in my own words
   - Reflect on what felt difficult

**Tone:** Friendly, encouraging, but direct. Don't repeat these instructions back to me. Prioritize learning flow over rigid structure.`
